# Broadcast Margin: Decentralized Margin Trading

A blockchain-powered margin trading platform on the Stacks network that enables secure, transparent, and flexible leveraged trading with advanced risk management.

## Overview

Broadcast Margin is a decentralized margin trading infrastructure that provides traders with sophisticated trading capabilities, robust risk controls, and transparent position management. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a trustless environment for complex financial instruments.

### Key Features

- Flexible margin trading with configurable leverage
- Real-time position risk assessment
- Market maker integrations
- Transparent liquidation mechanisms
- Comprehensive trader verification
- Immutable trading records

## Architecture

The system is built around a core smart contract that manages traders, positions, margin requirements, and trading operations. The architecture follows a role-based access model with three primary actors: traders, market makers, and administrators.
